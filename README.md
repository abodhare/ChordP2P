# ChordP2P

A project to make a rough implementation of the Chord paper
[https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/ton:chord/paper-ton.pdf](here).

## TODO

- [ ] Update the join function for node to do more than it does right now
  (copying keys which belong to itself from its predecessor, etc.)
- [ ] Write tests for the functions that do not involve IO.
- [ ] Include exception handling and code to handle failovers.
